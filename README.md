# 📊 Predicting Patient Readmission Using Binary Logistic Regression  
*A machine learning approach for hospital readmission prediction.*  

## 📜 Project Description  
This project examines the likelihood of **diabetes-related patient readmission** within **30 days or after 30 days** of hospitalization using **Binary Logistic Regression**. By analyzing **101,763 patient records** with **47 features**, the study identifies key factors influencing readmission rates and evaluates model performance using multiple metrics.  

### Key Highlights:  
- **Hospital Readmission Analysis:** Investigating patient characteristics and medical history affecting readmission.  
- **Binary Classification:** Predicting readmission status (`1` for readmitted, `0` for not readmitted).  
- **Feature Engineering:** Exploring influential factors like **age, prior hospital visits, medication use, and lab results**.  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, class imbalance, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Using **accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and ROC-AUC** for model assessment.  

Findings emphasize the **importance of early detection** of high-risk patients and offer insights for **hospital decision-making and healthcare optimization**. 🚀

## 🔢 Data Sources  
The dataset is adapted from **B. Strack et al.'s 2014 research**, containing **101,763 patient records** with **47 features** covering:  
- **Demographics:** Age, gender, race  
- **Medical History:** Prior hospitalizations, diagnoses, medication use  
- **Hospitalization Details:** Admission type, length of stay, discharge disposition  
- **Readmission Status:** Binary target variable (`1` = Readmitted, `0` = Not readmitted)  

---

## 📈 Results & Findings  
- **Influential Factors:** **Number of emergency visits, diagnoses, and diabetes medication usage** impact readmission rates significantly.  
- **Model Accuracy:** **62.1%**, reflecting a moderate ability to predict readmissions.  
- **ROC-AUC Score:** **0.66**, indicating room for improvement in discriminating readmitted vs. non-readmitted patients.  
- **Feature Importance:** Emergency visits (`10.2%` impact), multiple diagnoses (`7.8%`), diabetes medications (`6.4%`).  

The study reinforces the **need for improved predictive models** in healthcare analytics, highlighting areas for enhancement in **feature selection and model optimization**.

## 🚧 Limitations  
- **Class Imbalance:** Fewer readmission cases compared to non-readmission cases, potentially affecting prediction accuracy.  
- **Data Bias:** The dataset focuses on diabetes-related readmission, limiting generalizability to other medical conditions.  
- **Interpretability vs. Accuracy:** While deep learning models may improve accuracy, **Logistic Regression remains preferred for interpretability** in healthcare decisions.
